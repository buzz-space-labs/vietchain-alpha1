# Anamd

Official client for Anam Chain

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

### **Node.js**

To install Node.js, we recommend using NVM (Node Version Manager)â€”a handy tool that makes it easy to install and switch between different Node.js versions from the command line. You can get started by running the following command:

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
```

Example
```
$ nvm use 16
Now using node v16.9.1 (npm v7.21.1)
$ node -v
v16.9.1
$ nvm use 14
Now using node v14.18.0 (npm v6.14.15)
$ node -v
v14.18.0
$ nvm install 12
Now using node v12.22.6 (npm v6.14.5)
$ node -v
v12.22.6
```
### **Go**

Anam Chain requires a Go version later than 1.19. To manage different Go versions on your system effortlessly, we recommend using GVM (Golang Version Manager). You can install it by running the following command:

```
bash < <(curl -s -S -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moovweb/gvm/master/binscripts/gvm-installer)
```

**Install Go using GVM**

After you've installed GVM, you can easily install go by running this:

```
gvm install go1.19.1 -B
gvm use go1.19.1
```

### **Rust**

To build on the Anam Chain, Rust is required. The easiest way to install it is via Rustup, the official installer and version manager for Rust. For a more comprehensive setup guide, feel free to explore the Rust [Getting Started](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) page.

**Install Rust**

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

**Configuring the PATH environment variable**

All Rust tools are installed to the ~/.cargo/bin directory. There you will find the rustc, cargo and rustup binaries. To add them to your PATH, open in your desired editor and add the directory to it.

```
sudo nano ~/.profile
```

Add to the end of ~/.bashrc the following line:

```
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
```

Then save it and check the current cargo version and update rustup:

```
rustup default stable
cargo version
# If this is lower than 1.55.0, update
rustup update stable
```

You also need to install cargo-generate and cargo-run-script. You can do so with the following commands:

```
cargo install cargo-generate --features vendored-openssl
cargo install cargo-run-script
```

### **Wasm**

Wasm (wasmd) is the backbone of the CosmWasm platform. It is the implementation of a Cosmos zone with wasm smart contracts enabled.

**Install the wasm32 target**

```
# Check the target toolchains of rustup
rustup target list --installed
# Add the wasm toolchain
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### **Install Anam CLI**

The anamd binary is the official client for Anam Chain. To install it, you need to clone the anam repo:

```
https://github.com/buzz-space-labs/vietchain-alpha1.git
```

And install it using makefile:

```
cd vietchain-alpha1
make
```

## Anamd Guild Testing

### 1. Install Anamd CLI

### 2. Create a Wallet

```
anamd keys add alice --keyring-backend test
```

Get wallet's address

```
anamd keys show alice -a --keyring-backend test
```

### 3. Faucet

Copy your wallet's address to [this page](https://faucet.anam.foundation/).

### 4. Check your balance

```
anamd query bank balances <your-wallet-address> --node <anam-chain-rpc>
```

[`anam-chain-rpc`](./infra/rpc.md) is the official RPC endpoint for Anam Chain.

### ðŸ’¸ Transfer Token

```
anamd tx bank send alice <recipient-address> 1000000uanam \
  --from alice \
  --chain-id anam \
  --fees 5000uanam \
  --gas auto \
  --gas-adjustment 1.3 \
  --keyring-backend test \
  --node <anam-chain-rpc>
```
